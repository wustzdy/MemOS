# MemOS: Memory Operating System for AI Agents

MemOS is an open-source **Agent Memory framework** that empowers AI agents with **long-term memory, personality consistency, and contextual recall**. It enables agents to **remember past interactions**, **learn over time**, and **build evolving identities** across sessions.

Designed for **AI companions, role-playing NPCs, and multi-agent systems**, MemOS provides a unified API for **memory representation, retrieval, and update** — making it the foundation for next-generation **memory-augmented AI agents**.

🆕 **MemOS 2.0** introduces **knowledge base system**, **multi-modal memory** (images & documents), **tool memory** for Agent optimization, **memory feedback mechanism** for precise control, and **enterprise-grade architecture** with Redis Streams scheduler and advanced DB optimizations.

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### Get API Key
  - Sign up and get started on[`MemOS dashboard`](https://memos-dashboard.openmem.net/cn/quickstart/?source=landing)
  - Open the API Keys Console in the MemOS dashboard and copy the API Key into the initialization code

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install MemoryOS -U
```

### Basic Usage

- Initialize MemOS client with API Key to start sending requests
```python
# Please make sure MemoS is installed (pip install MemoryOS -U)
from memos.api.client import MemOSClient

# Initialize the client using the API Key
client = MemOSClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

- This API allows you to add one or more messages to a specific conversation. As illustrated in the examples bellow, you can add messages in real time during a user-assistant interaction, import historical messages in bulk, or enrich the conversation with user preferences and behavior data. All added messages are transformed into memories by MemOS, enabling their retrieval in future conversations to support chat history management, user behavior tracking, and personalized interactions.
```python
messages = [
  {"role": "user", "content": "I have planned to travel to Guangzhou during the summer vacation. What chain hotels are available for accommodation?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can consider [7 Days, All Seasons, Hilton], and so on."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "I'll choose 7 Days"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, ask me if you have any other questions."}
]
user_id = "memos_user_123"
conversation_id = "0610"
res = client.add_message(messages=messages, user_id=user_id, conversation_id=conversation_id)

print(f"result: {res}")
```

- This API allows you to query a user’s memory and returns the fragments most relevant to the input. These can serve as references for the model when generating responses. As shown in the examples bellow, You can retrieve memory in real time during a user’s conversation with the AI, or perform a global search across their entire memory to create user profiles or support personalized recommendations, improving both dialogue coherence and personalization.
In the latest update, in addition to “Fact Memory”, the system now supports “Preference Memory”, enabling LLM to respond in a way that better understands the user.
```python
query = "I want to go out to play during National Day. Can you recommend a city I haven't been to and a hotel brand I haven't stayed at?"
user_id = "memos_user_123"
conversation_id = "0610"
res = client.search_memory(query=query, user_id=user_id, conversation_id=conversation_id)

print(f"result: {res}")
```

- This API is used to delete specified user memories, supporting batch deletion.
```python
user_ids = ["memos_user_123"]
# Replace with the memory ID
memory_ids = ["6b23b583-f4c4-4a8f-b345-58d0c48fea04"]
res = client.delete_memory(user_ids=user_ids, memory_ids=memory_ids)

print(f"result: {res}")
```

- This API is used to add feedback to current session messages, allowing MemOS to correct memories based on user feedback.
```python
user_id = "memos_user_123"
conversation_id = "memos_feedback_conv"
feedback_content = "No, let's change it now to a meal allowance of 150 yuan per day and a lodging subsidy of 700 yuan per day for first-tier cities; for second- and third-tier cities, it remains the same as before."
# Replace with the knowledgebase ID
allow_knowledgebase_ids = ["basee5ec9050-c964-484f-abf1-ce3e8e2aa5b7"]

res = client.add_feedback(
    user_id=user_id,
    conversation_id=conversation_id,
    feedback_content=feedback_content,
    allow_knowledgebase_ids=allow_knowledgebase_ids
)

print(f"result: {res}")
```

- This API is used to create a knowledgebase associated with a project
```python
knowledgebase_name = "Financial Reimbursement Knowledge Base"
knowledgebase_description = "A compilation of all knowledge related to the company's financial reimbursements."

res = client.create_knowledgebase(
    knowledgebase_name=knowledgebase_name,
    knowledgebase_description=knowledgebase_description
)
print(f"result: {res}")
```
