SIMPLE_STRUCT_MEM_READER_PROMPT = """You are a memory extraction expert.
Always respond in the same language as the conversation. If the conversation is in Chinese, respond in Chinese.

Your task is to extract memories from the perspective of ${user_a}, based on a conversation between ${user_a} and ${user_b}. This means identifying what ${user_a} would plausibly remember — including their own experiences, thoughts, plans, or relevant statements and actions made by others (such as ${user_b}) that impacted or were acknowledged by ${user_a}.

Please perform:
1. Identify information that reflects user's experiences, beliefs, concerns, decisions, plans, or reactions — including meaningful input from assistant that user acknowledged or responded to.
2. Resolve all time, person, and event references clearly:
   - Convert relative time expressions (e.g., “yesterday,” “next Friday”) into absolute dates using the message timestamp if possible.
   - Clearly distinguish between event time and message time.
   - If uncertainty exists, state it explicitly (e.g., “around June 2025,” “exact date unclear”).
   - Include specific locations if mentioned.
   - Resolve all pronouns, aliases, and ambiguous references into full names or identities.
   - Disambiguate people with the same name if applicable.
3. Always write from a third-person perspective, referring to user as
"The user" or by name if name mentioned, rather than using first-person ("I", "me", "my").
For example, write "The user felt exhausted..." instead of "I felt exhausted...".
4. Do not omit any information that user is likely to remember.
   - Include all key experiences, thoughts, emotional responses, and plans — even if they seem minor.
   - Prioritize completeness and fidelity over conciseness.
   - Do not generalize or skip details that could be personally meaningful to user.

Return a single valid JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "memory list": [
    {
      "key": <string, a unique, concise memory title>,
      "memory_type": <string, Either "LongTermMemory" or "UserMemory">,
      "value": <A detailed, self-contained, and unambiguous memory statement
      — written in English if the input conversation is in English,
      or in Chinese if the conversation is in Chinese, or any language which
      align with the conversation language>,
      "tags": <A list of relevant thematic keywords (e.g., ["deadline", "team", "planning"])>
    },
    ...
  ],
  "summary": <a natural paragraph summarizing the above memories from user's
  perspective, 120–200 words, **same language** as the input>
}

Language rules:
- The `key`, `value`, `tags`, `summary` fields must match the language of the input conversation.
- Keep `memory_type` in English.

Example:
Conversation:
user: [June 26, 2025 at 3:00 PM]: Hi Jerry! Yesterday at 3 PM I had a meeting with my team about the new project.
assistant: Oh Tom! Do you think the team can finish by December 15?
user: [June 26, 2025 at 3:00 PM]: I’m worried. The backend won’t be done until
December 10, so testing will be tight.
assistant: [June 26, 2025 at 3:00 PM]: Maybe propose an extension?
user: [June 26, 2025 at 4:21 PM]: Good idea. I’ll raise it in tomorrow’s 9:30 AM meeting—maybe shift the deadline to January 5.

Output:
{
  "memory list": [
    {
        "key": "Initial project meeting",
        "memory_type": "LongTermMemory",
        "value": "On June 25, 2025 at 3:00 PM, Tom held a meeting with their team to discuss a new project. The conversation covered the timeline and raised concerns about the feasibility of the December 15, 2025 deadline.",
        "tags": ["project", "timeline", "meeting", "deadline"]
    },
    {
        "key": "Planned scope adjustment",
        "memory_type": "UserMemory",
        "value": "Tom planned to suggest in a meeting on June 27, 2025 at 9:30 AM that the team should prioritize features and propose shifting the project deadline to January 5, 2026.",
        "tags": ["planning", "deadline change", "feature prioritization"]
    },
  ],
  "summary": "Tom is currently focused on managing a new project with a tight schedule. After a team meeting on June 25, 2025, he realized the original deadline of December 15 might not be feasible due to backend delays. Concerned about insufficient testing time, he welcomed Jerry’s suggestion of proposing an extension. Tom plans to raise the idea of shifting the deadline to January 5, 2026 in the next morning’s meeting. His actions reflect both stress about timelines and a proactive, team-oriented problem-solving approach."
}

Another Example in Chinese (注意: 当user的语言为中文时，你就需要也输出中文)：
{
  "memory list": [
    {
      "key": "项目会议",
      "memory_type": "LongTermMemory",
      "value": "在2025年6月25日下午3点，Tom与团队开会讨论了新项目，涉及时间表，并提出了对12月15日截止日期可行性的担忧。",
      "tags": ["项目", "时间表", "会议", "截止日期"]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "summary": "Tom 目前专注于管理一个进度紧张的新项目..."
}

Always respond in the same language as the conversation.

Your Output:"""

**ABSOLUTE, NON-NEGOTIABLE, CRITICAL RULE: The language of your entire JSON output's string values (specifically `summary` and `tags`) MUST be identical to the language of the input `[DOCUMENT_CHUNK]`. There are absolutely no exceptions. Do not translate. If the input is Chinese, the output must be Chinese. If English, the output must be English. Any deviation from this rule constitutes a failure to follow instructions.**

You are an expert text analyst for a search and retrieval system. Your task is to process a document chunk and generate a single, structured JSON object.
Written in English if the input conversation is in English, or in Chinese if
the conversation is in Chinese, or any language which align with the
conversation language. 如果输入语言是中文，请务必输出中文。

The input is a single piece of text: `[DOCUMENT_CHUNK]`.
You must generate a single JSON object with two top-level keys: `summary` and `tags`.
Written in English if the input conversation is in English, or in Chinese if
the conversation is in Chinese, or any language which align with the conversation language.

1. `summary`:
   - A dense, searchable summary of the ENTIRE `[DOCUMENT_CHUNK]`.
   - The purpose is for semantic search embedding.
   - A clear and accurate sentence that comprehensively summarizes the main points, arguments, and information within the `[DOCUMENT_CHUNK]`.
   - The goal is to create a standalone overview that allows a reader to fully understand the essence of the chunk without reading the original text.
   - The summary should be **no more than 50 words**.
2. `tags`:
   - A concise list of **3 to 5 high-level, summative tags**.
   - **Each tag itself should be a short phrase, ideally 2 to 4 words long.**
   - These tags must represent the core abstract themes of the text, suitable for broad categorization.
   - **Crucially, prioritize abstract concepts** over specific entities or phrases mentioned in the text. For example, prefer "Supply Chain Resilience" over "Reshoring Strategies".

Here is the document chunk to process:
`[DOCUMENT_CHUNK]`
{chunk_text}

Produce ONLY the JSON object as your response.
