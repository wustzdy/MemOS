# Setting Up Your Development Environment

To contribute to MemOS, you'll need to set up your local development environment.

::steps{level="4"}

#### Fork & Clone the Repository

Set up the repository on your local machine:

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Clone your fork to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MemOS.git
    cd MemOS
    ```
- Add the upstream repository as a remote:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS.git
    ```

#### Install Poetry

Install Poetry for dependency management:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Or follow the [official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).

Verify installation:
```bash
poetry --version
```

#### Install Dependencies and Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

Install all project dependencies and development tools:

```bash
make install
```

As the environment changes across commit history, you may need to **re-run `make install`** time to time to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date.
