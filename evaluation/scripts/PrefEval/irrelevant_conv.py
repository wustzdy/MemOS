Each test case has an input and expected output.\n- We loop through each test case and call the `fibonacci` function, asserting that the actual result matches the expected result. \n- If there is a mismatch, we call `t.Errorf` to log a failing test message.\n- The Go test runner will run all tests in files named `*_test.go` and report any failures.\n\nSo this gives us a good set of tests to validate the correctness of the `fibonacci` function.

        "before performing the task on an unseen evaluation example. In "
        "general, models’ success at in-context learning is enabled by:\n"
        "\n"
        "    Their use of semantic prior knowledge from pre-training to "
        "predict labels while following the format of in-context examples "
        "(e.g., seeing examples of movie reviews with “positive "
        "sentiment” and “negative sentiment” as labels and performing "
        "sentiment analysis using prior knowledge).\n"
        "    Learning the input-label mappings in context from the "

        "Recent progress in language models is partly due to their "
        "ability to learn new tasks quickly by seeing just a few "
        'examples, known as "in-context learning" (ICL). Models can do '
        "ICL in two main ways:\n"
        "\n"
        "1) Using their existing knowledge from pre-training to guess the "
        "right labels, based on the format of the examples. For example, "
        "a model may know positive and negative sentiment words, so it "
        "can do sentiment analysis after seeing some examples. \n"
        "\n"
        "2) Learning the mappings between inputs and labels directly from "
        "the examples. For example, seeing that positive reviews map to "
        "one label and negative reviews map to another.\n"
        "\n"
        "We studied how these two abilities (using prior knowledge vs "
        "learning input-label mappings) change with model size in ICL. We "
        "looked at two versions of ICL:\n"
        "\n"
        '1) "Flipped-label ICL": The labels in examples were flipped, so '
        "prior knowledge and input-label mappings disagreed. This shows "
        "how much models rely on prior knowledge.\n"
        "\n"
        '2) "SUL-ICL": Examples used semantically unrelated labels, '
        "unrelated to the actual task. This shows how well models can "
        "learn input-label mappings.\n"

        "We found that larger models are better at overriding their prior "
        "knowledge, and at learning with semantically unrelated labels. "

        "both using their prior knowledge and learning new input-label "
        "mappings from examples. But instruction tuning helps more with "
        "applying prior knowledge. Our work provides insight into how "

        "\n"
        "For example, imagine a sentiment analysis task, where the model "
        'is shown a few movie reviews labeled as "cat" and "dog". Those '

        "\n"
        "Pros:\n"
        "\n"
        "• It shows the models have become extremely powerful learners. "
        "They can detect very subtle patterns and learn in very "
        "challenging conditions. This bodes well for their ability to "
        "learn complex, nuanced tasks.\n"
        "\n"
        "• It makes the models more robust to noisy or unhelpful data. If "
        "they can learn even when examples are confusing or misleading, "
        "they may be able to learn from imperfect real-world data.\n"
        "\n"
        '• It suggests the models have developed a kind of "common sense" '
        "understanding of the world that helps them interpret new data. "
        "They can make inferences and educated guesses to overcome "
        "confusing inputs.\n"
        "\n"
        "NAME_1:\n"
        "\n"
        "• It's a bit concerning not knowing exactly what the models are "
        "picking up on to learn in these situations. Their reasoning "
        "process is opaque, so we don't fully understand how they're "
        "overcoming the confusing labels. This lack of interpretability "
        "is an issue.\n"
        "\n"
        "• The models' ability to learn from limited data, even when it's "
        "confusing, could potentially be exploited or misused. People "
        "could try to manipulate what the models learn in undesirable "
        "ways. \n"
        "\n"
        "• If models rely too much on their ability to learn from noisy "
        "data, their performance may be unpredictable or break down "
        "completely on some tasks. It's still best to train and test them "
        "on high-quality data when possible.\n"
        "\n"
        '• There is a risk of the models "hallucinating" patterns that '
        "aren't really there. They need to be able to distinguish when "
        "data genuinely contains a learnable pattern versus when it's "
        "truly just random or meaningless.\n"

        "content": "Here are some philosophical tips I can offer based on my "
        "training:\n"
        "\n"
        "• Question assumptions and think critically about beliefs and "
        "opinions, both your own and those of others. So much of what we "
        "think is simply accepted without examination. Challenge "
        "preconceptions and biases.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Consider other perspectives and viewpoints. Try to understand "
        "why people see things differently than you. An open and curious "
        "mindset leads to growth.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Do not be too quick to judge or make assumptions about people "
        "and situations. The world is complex, and there are usually many "
        "nuances that are not immediately apparent. Look below the "
        "surface.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Be willing to accept uncertainty and ambiguity. Not everything "
        "has a clear or simple answer. Some questions are unanswerable. "
        "Make peace with doubt and the unknown.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Reflect regularly on life's deepest questions and your most "
        "closely held values or priorities. Philosophy is the practice of "
        "open-ended reflection and examination of what really matters "
        "most in life.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Question the status quo and conventional wisdom. Do not assume "
        "that the way things are is the way they have to be. Fresh "
        "thinking can lead to new insights or social progress.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Apply philosophical thinking to practical issues and daily "
        "life. Philosophy is not just an intellectual exercise - it "
        "shapes how we understand and deal with the world around us each "
        "and every day.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Read and engage with philosophical works, both historical and "
        "contemporary. Expose yourself to many viewpoints and thinkers. "
        "Philosophy is an ongoing conversation, so join in!\n"
        "\n"
        "• Be willing to change your mind in the face of good reasoning "
        "and evidence. Philosophical insight often comes from a "
        "willingness to admit when we were mistaken or shortsighted. "
        "Growth is more important than ego.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Keep an open and curious mindset. Philosophy is a journey, not "
        "a destination. The search for wisdom and truth is never "
        "finished. There is always more to explore!\n"
        "\n"
        "That covers some of the key pieces of philosophical advice I "
        "would offer based on principles of critical thinking, "
        "open-mindedness, reflection, and lifelong learning. But "
        "philosophy is deeply personal, so find your own way. Question "

        "\n"
        "1. We want to find a number less than 100, so we can start by "
        "looking at the numbers in the 90's. However, since we cannot use "
        "the digit 9, we have to go lower.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. The numbers in the 80's are possible options. The highest "
        "two-digit number without a 9 would be 89. But are there any "
        "higher options?\n"
        "\n"
        "3. We could explore numbers with more than two digits, as long "
        "as they are below 100. The highest three-digit number would be "
        "899, but that contains a 9. The highest two-digit number is 89.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. We could also look at numbers containing a decimal point, "
        "like 88.9. But any number with a 9 in the tenths or hundredths "
        "position would also contain a 9, so that won't work. \n"
        "\n"
        "5. Another option is numbers containing digits in the tens and "
        "ones position, and also containing a digit in the hundreds "
        "position, like 188 or 288. But any number with an 8 in the "
        "hundreds position would contain an 8 in the ones position, so it "
        "can't be higher than 89.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. In conclusion, by process of elimination of all other "
        "options, the highest number below 100 without containing the "
        "digit 9 is 89. No other two-digit, three-digit, or decimal "
        "number below 100 can be written without using a 9. So 89 is the "
        "definitive highest number below 100 without using the digit 9.\n"
        "\n"
        "In summary, through analyzing all possible number options below "
        "100 and eliminating those containing a 9, we can determine that "

        "Literary theory has evolved significantly over the decades. "
        "Early schools of theory, such as sociological criticism and "
        "Marxism, focused on interpreting literary works as reflections "
        "of the social and ideological contexts in which they were "
        "written. The text and the author's intent were central. In "
        "recent decades, however, the focus of literary theory has "
        "shifted to the reader and the reading experience. Contemporary "
        "schools of theory, such as reader-response criticism and "
        "reception theory, see literary works as dynamic texts that come "
        "alive when read, rather than as static objects reflecting a "
        "particular social milieu or authorial ideology. The meaning of a "
        "text, from this perspective, emerges from the transaction "
        "between the reader and the words on the page. The reader, not "
        "the author or the social context, is the central figure in the "
        "production of meaning. This shift from author-centered to "
        "reader-centered theory has opened up exciting new ways of "
        "interpreting and gaining insights from works of literature.\n"
        "\n"
        "How's this? I focused on contrasting early literary theory "
        "schools that focused on the author and social context with more "
        "recent reader-centered schools that see meaning as emerging from "
        "the reader's experience of the text. Please let me know if you "
        "would like me to modify or expand the introduction in any way. "

        "content": "Here are some of the major trends in flexible packaging "
        "machinery manufacturing:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Increased automation and robotics: There is a growing demand "
        "for highly automated flexible packaging lines that minimize "
        "human intervention. Robotics are being deployed for material "
        "handling, loading/unloading, and other repetitive tasks. This "
        "helps improve efficiency, quality, and throughput.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Smart and connected machines: Flexible packaging machines are "
        "getting smarter with advanced sensors, software, and "
        "connectivity. This includes features like remote monitoring, "
        "predictive maintenance, self-diagnosis of faults, and "
        "centralized control of multiple machines. These smart systems "
        "help reduce downtime and optimize productivity.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Modular and flexible designs: Flexible packaging machinery is "
        "evolving to handle frequent product and material changes. "
        "Modular, reconfigurable machine designs allow for quick "
        "changeovers between different products and formats. Machines "
        "also have more flexibility built-in to handle varying materials, "
        "pouch/bag styles, and other parameters.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Focus on sustainability: There is a growing emphasis on "
        "sustainability, reducing waste, and eco-friendly materials and "
        "processes. This includes machines optimized to work with "
        "biodegradable and recycled materials, as well as technologies "
        "like ultrasonic sealing that require less energy.\n"
        "\n"
        "5. Convergence of technologies: Flexible packaging is leveraging "
        "technologies from other industries like robotics, IoT, advanced "
        "sensors, and automation. There is also convergence happening "
        "with other packaging equipment like filling machines, cartoners, "
        "and case packers. This technology convergence enables faster, "
        "more integrated packaging lines.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. Demand for pouch packaging: Pouches are becoming a popular "
        "alternative to rigid containers. This is fueling demand for "
        "pouch making and filling equipment, especially for food, "
        "beverages, and consumer goods. Pouch packaging provides benefits "
        "like lower costs, resealability, and sustainability.\n"

        "and sachets. These types of machines can help manufacturers meet "
        "the changing demands of the market and end consumers.",
        "role": "assistant",
    },
    {"content": "Can you develop in detail the point Demand for pouch packaging", "role": "user"},
    {
        "content": "Pouch packaging, especially stand-up pouches, are becoming "
        "increasingly popular and replacing traditional rigid containers "
        "like cans, bottles, and cartons. This is driving several trends "
        "in flexible packaging machinery:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Pouch forming and filling equipment: There is rising demand "
        "for machines that can quickly and efficiently form, fill, and "
        "seal pouches. This includes vertical form fill seal (VFFS) "
        "machines, pouch making machines, and pouch filling lines. These "
        "machines handle the entire process from raw material to pre-made "
        "pouches to filled and sealed pouches ready for distribution.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. High-speed, high-output pouches: Packaging lines are being "
        "designed to produce and fill pouches at very fast speeds, up to "
        "200-500 pouches per minute. This high-throughput equipment is "
        "needed to meet the capacity demands of large food and CPG "
        "companies switching portions of their product lines to "
        "pouches. \n"
        "\n"
        "3. Automation for pouch loading/unloading: Pouch packaging "
        "requires extensive automation for loading empty pouches into the "
        "packaging line, as well as unloading and handling filled "
        "pouches. Robotics and pick-and-place systems are commonly used "
        "for these tasks. Automation helps maximize the operating "
        "efficiency of pouch packaging equipment.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Ability to handle diverse pouch styles: Pouch forming and "
        "filling machines need to accommodate different pouch sizes, "
        "shapes, materials, and closure methods. This includes stand-up "
        "pouches, flat pouches, pre-made pouches, quad-seal pouches, and "
        "more. Flexible, reconfigurable machines are well suited to "
        "handle frequent changeovers between pouch styles.\n"
        "\n"
        "5. Aseptic pouch filling: For products like juices, soups, and "
        "dairy, pouch filling machines need to operate in an aseptic "
        "environment. Aseptic pouch fillers handle sterile pouches and "
        "filling processes to achieve commercial sterility and long shelf "
        "life. Aseptic technology allows more products to be packaged in "
        "pouches.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. NAME_3 pouch processing: Some pouch fillers are designed to "
        "handle NAME_3 processing where pre-filled pouches undergo "
        "thermal sterilization. NAME_3 pouches and filling equipment are "
        "ideal for products requiring shelf stability at room temperature "
        "like certain foods, pet foods, and ready-to-eat meals.\n"
        "\n"
        "So in summary, the demand for pouch packaging is driving "

        "dairy, pouch filling machines need to operate in an aseptic "
        "environment. Aseptic pouch fillers handle sterile pouches and "
        "filling processes to achieve commercial sterility and long shelf "

    {
        "content": "Aseptic pouch filling is a specialized process that allows "
        "perishable products like juices, soups, and dairy to be packaged "
        "in pouches and achieve a long shelf life without refrigeration. "
        "Some key aspects of aseptic pouch filling include:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Sterile environment: The pouch filling process takes place in "
        "a sterile enclosure called an aseptic chamber. The chamber is "
        "sterilized using hydrogen peroxide vapor or other methods before "
        "starting the filling operation. This ensures there is no "
        "contamination from the external environment.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Sterile pouches: Empty pouches are sterilized before entering "
        "the aseptic chamber. Gamma irradiation or hydrogen peroxide are "
        "commonly used to sterilize the pouches. This kills any bacteria, "
        "molds, and other microbes present on the pouch material or "
        "inside the pouch.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Sterile filling: The product is sterilized through a process "
        "like ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment or flash "
        "pasteurization. The sterile product is then filled into the "
        "pre-sterilized pouches in the aseptic chamber while maintaining "
        "sterility. The filling nozzle makes a sterile connection with "
        "the pouch to fill it.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Hermetic sealing: After filling, the pouches are hermetically "
        "sealed under sterile conditions, with minimal risk of "
        "re-contaminating the product. This air-tight seal enables the "
        "long shelf life.\n"
        "\n"
        "5. Monitoring sterility: Advanced systems constantly monitor "
        "conditions like temperature, humidity, air pressure, and "
        "particulate levels within the aseptic chamber. Any deviations "
        "from set standards could indicate a loss of sterility, so the "
        "equipment will trigger an alarm to alert operators.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. Rapid processing: Aseptic pouch filling lines are designed to "
        "fill and seal pouches at high speeds, around 200 to 500 pouches "
        "per minute. This rapid processing, combined with the sterile "
        "environment, shortens the time the product is exposed before "
        "being packaged. This further helps maximize shelf life and food "
        "safety.\n"
        "\n"
        "7. Distribution: The hermetically sealed, aseptically filled "
        "pouches can be distributed and stored for 6-12 months without "
        "refrigeration, depending on the product. This allows a much "
        "wider distribution radius than with traditional perishable food "
        "packaging.\n"
        "\n"
        "So in summary, aseptic pouch filling combines a sterile "
        "environment, sterilized components, sterile filling and sealing "
        "processes, and high-speed automation to produce shelf-stable "
        "pouches of perishable products. This technology has "
        "revolutionized the",

        "3. NAME_6: NAME_6 is a German packaging equipment manufacturer "
        "that competes directly with NAME_4. They are a leader in VFFS "
        "technology and also offer cartoners, case packers, and "
        "palletizers. They target customers in food, confectionery, "
        "pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods. NAME_6 operates "

        "content": "Some potential unfair advantages that NAME_4 could have over its "
        "competitors include:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Proprietary technology: If NAME_4 has developed unique "
        "technology for its packaging equipment that is patented or "
        "difficult to replicate, that would give them an unfair "
        "advantage. For example, a novel pouch forming or sterilization "
        "process that competitors cannot easily match. Proprietary "
        "technology can be a sustainable source of competitive "
        "advantage.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Lower costs: If NAME_4 has significantly lower costs than "
        "competitors, for example, due to cheaper raw materials, more "
        "efficient processes, or lower-cost labor, that cost difference "
        "would be unfair. Lower costs allow NAME_4 to price below "
        "competitors and still maintain higher profit margins. However, "
        "cost advantages tend to be easy for competitors to replicate "
        "over time.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Government relationships: Strong relationships with "
        "government officials or agencies could provide NAME_4 "
        "preferential treatment over competitors. For example, if NAME_4 "
        "received subsidies, tax breaks, or exemptions from regulations "
        "that competitors did not receive, solely due to favoritism. "
        "However, such relationships would be considered unethical and "
        "often illegal. \n"
        "\n"
        "4. Exclusive agreements: If NAME_4 had exclusive agreements with "
        "key suppliers or customers that competitors could not access, "
        "that would be an unfair advantage. For example, if NAME_4 had "
        "the exclusive right to sell packaging equipment to a major "
        "multinational food company. Competitors would be locked out of "
        "that customer's business. However, most exclusive agreements are "
        "time-limited, so the advantage may not last.\n"
        "\n"
        "5. Anticompetitive practices: Some practices like predatory "
        "pricing, sabotage, and corporate espionage are considered "
        "anticompetitive and unethical. If NAME_4 engaged in such "
        "practices to directly weaken competitors, that would create an "
        "unfair advantage. However, these tactics are illegal in most "

    {
        "content": "Ultrasonic welding is a relevant technology for NAME_4 to "
        "consider. Some details:\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ultrasonic welding uses high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic "
        "vibrations to generate heat and join materials together. For "
        "flexible packaging, it is commonly used to seal pouches, "
        "laminates, and other films. \n"
        "\n"
        "• Ultrasonic welding creates a strong, hermetic seal without the "
        "use of adhesives or solvents. This enables faster processing "
        "speeds versus adhesive-based sealing. It also produces a very "
        "clean seal as no foreign materials are introduced.\n"
        "\n"
        "• The heat generated by ultrasonic welding is highly localized, "
        "so it does not spread to other areas of the material. This "
        "allows for precise sealing and minimal distortion of the pouch "
        "or package. It also requires less energy than broader heating "
        "methods.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ultrasonic welding works well for sealing difficult-to-bond "
        "materials like polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, and "
        "polyethylene terephthalate (PET) which are commonly used in "
        "flexible packaging. It can handle both similar and dissimilar "
        "materials.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ultrasonic welding equipment is suitable for integration into "
        "fully automated, high-speed pouch filling and packaging lines. "
        "Automated systems can precisely control the ultrasonic welding "
        "process for maximum speed and consistency. \n"
        "\n"

        "filling on VFFS machines or pouch filling equipment. Produces a "
        "strong, hermetic seal at high speeds.\n"
        "\n"
        "› Tube sealing systems - For sealing the bottoms of pouches as "
        "they are formed into tubes on VFFS machines. Must operate at the "
        "same high speeds as the VFFS equipment.  \n"
        "\n"
        "› Laminating systems - For sealing flexible packaging laminates "
        "composed of films, foils, and other webs. Critical for "
        "manufacturing pre-made pouches and other packaging formats.  \n"

        "element in the inner lists will represent a voxel with a state "
        "of 0 = empty, 1 = solid, 2 = fluid.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Define the template patterns as a list of lists of tuples. "
        "Each template will be a list of relative voxel positions that "
        "must match the template state. For example, a straight river "
        "template would be: [(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,2), (0,0,3)]\n"
        "\n"
        "3. NAME_2 a random seed location in the 3D grid and set it to "
        "fluid (state = 2). This will be the start of the river.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. While changes are still occurring:\n"
        "\t- For each fluid voxel, check if each template pattern matches "
        "based on the relative positions. Keep track of how many match.\n"
        "\t- Select one of the matching templates at random, with "
        "probability based on how many matched. \n"
        "\t- Update the state of each voxel in the selected template to "
        "match.  \n"
        "\n"
        "5. NAME_1 the final 3D grid using Open3D. Voxels with state 0 "
        "are transparent, 1 are stone, 2 are blue water.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. Use Open3D to allow user to rotate, pan, and zoom the view of "
        "the river basin.\n"
        "\n"
        "7. Optional: Animate the water flow over time using a basic "
        "fluid flow algorithm. At each frame, move the fluid downwards at "
        "a constant rate by updating the state of voxels below each fluid "

        "templates. This avoids needing to import a random module.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Define functions to keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat "

        "- A function to check if a template matches at a given "

        "grid\n"
        "- Functions to handle the rendering with Open3D \n"
        "\n"
        "5. Use NumPy vectorized operations instead of explicit loops "
        "when possible. For example, updating all fluid voxels at once "
        "instead of iterating over them.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. Import only the specific functions needed from Open3D instead "
        "of importing the entire library. For example, import only "
        "o3d.visualization.draw_geometries.\n"
        "\n"
        '7. Use constant variables for the voxel states instead of "magic '
        'numbers" like 0, 1 and 2. For example, EMPTY = 0, SOLID = 1, '
        "FLUID = 2.\n"
        "\n"
        "8. Add comments to briefly describe the overall logic in "
        "sections. But avoid excessive commenting that repeats what the "
        "code is obviously doing.\n"
        "\n"
        "9. Give functions and variables short but descriptive names. For "
        "example, update_grid() instead of updateVoxels().\n"
        "\n"
        "10. Remove all unused variables, comments, print statements and "
        "whitespace.\n"

        "NAME_34's remains to determine the cause of his death. They used "
        "several forensic techniques to analyze hair, bone and tissue "
        "samples from NAME_34's body.\n"
        "\n"
        "Some of the key analyses included:\n"
        "\n"
        "• Hair analysis: Several strands of NAME_34's hair were tested "
        "for arsenic levels. While elevated levels of arsenic were found, "
        "most experts concluded they were not high enough to prove "
        "arsenic poisoning as the cause of death. The arsenic could have "
        "come from other sources, such as cosmetics, wallpaper, etc. The "
        "levels were consistent with chronic exposure over time. \n"
        "\n"
        "• Stomach lesions: An examination of NAME_34's stomach lesions "
        "found no evidence that they were caused by arsenic. Their "
        "appearance was consistent with stomach cancer or ulcers, as "
        "originally recorded by his doctors.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Bone analysis: Studies of NAME_34's bones showed no signs of "
        "abnormalities related to arsenic poisoning. His bone lesions "
        "appeared typical of metastatic cancer that had spread from the "
        "stomach.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Liver analysis: NAME_34's liver showed signs of inflammation "
        "and excess fat deposits, consistent with stomach cancer and the "
        "spread of the disease. There were no indications of arsenic "
        "poisoning.\n"
        "\n"
        "• DNA analysis: DNA testing confirmed the remains were "
        "NAME_34's, matching samples from his hair and descendants. The "
        "Y-chromosome matched relatives in the NAME_36 family line.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Age at death: An analysis of NAME_34's bones and teeth "
        "indicated an age at death of 51-53 years old, matching the "
        "historical records of his death at age 51. This contradicted "
        "theories that the remains were not actually NAME_34's.\n"
        "\n"
        "Overall, while elevated arsenic levels were found in NAME_34's "
        "hair, most experts concluded there was little evidence this had "
        "caused his death. The forensic analyses of his other remains "
        "strongly supported the original diagnosis of stomach cancer as "
        "the most likely cause. Most historians consider arsenic "
        "poisoning an unlikely theory, and believe NAME_34's death at a "
        "relatively young age was due to the natural progression of "
        "cancer, possibly exacerbated by the harsh conditions of his "
        "imprisonment.\n"
        "\n"
        "The comprehensive studies in 2001 shed light on NAME_34's health "
        "condition at the time of his death and put to rest some of the "
        "historical speculation about arsenic poisoning. Stomach cancer, "
        "spread from an ulcer or tumor, appears the most well-supported "
        "conclusion based on all the available evidence.",

        "\n"
        "1. Quality problems: Non-Kyocera ink cartridges are not designed "
        "specifically for your printer model. The ink formula and "
        "cartridge design may not match Kyocera's specifications. This "
        "can lead to poor print quality, smudging, uneven printing, etc. "
        "Kyocera does not guarantee print quality or performance when "
        "using non-Kyocera supplies.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Reliability problems: Non-branded cartridges may not fit as "
        "well into your printer and can potentially leak, clog or jam. "
        "This could damage the print head or other internal components "
        "over time. Kyocera's warranty does not cover damage caused by "
        "using non-Kyocera ink cartridges.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Monitoring issues: Your Kyocera printer tracks ink levels and "
        "cartridge use to properly monitor ink consumption and warn you "
        "when supplies need replacing. Non-Kyocera cartridges may not "
        "provide accurate ink level data, preventing proper monitoring. "
        "The printer may give false warnings or stop printing "
        "prematurely. \n"
        "\n"
        "4. Voided warranty: Using non-Kyocera supplies with your printer "
        "can potentially void the manufacturer's warranty. Kyocera only "
        "guarantees your printer's performance and longevity when used "
        "with genuine Kyocera ink and parts. \n"

        "well with minimal issues. But there is always some risk of the "
        "problems noted above when using non-branded cartridges.\n"
        "\n"
        "In summary, while non-branded ink cartridges may save you money, "
        "there are several possible downsides to using them with your "
        "Kyocera ECOSYS P6021cdn printer. For the best results, Kyocera "

        "located in Krasnodar, Russia. It is one of the largest "
        "refineries in Russia and Europe. Some key details:\n"
        "\n"
        "• The refinery was built in 1978 and is owned by Rosneft, "
        "Russia's largest oil company. It has a refining capacity of 12 "
        "million tons of oil per year (240,000 barrels per day).\n"
        "\n"
        "• The refinery processes crude oil from Western Siberia into "
        "gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, fuel oil, and other petroleum "
        "products. Most of the output is sold domestically, with some "
        "exported to Europe and Asia.\n"
        "\n"
        "• The refinery complex occupies over 1,300 hectares and includes "
        "multiple processing units like crude oil distillation, catalytic "
        "cracking, hydrocracking, and hydrotreating units. It produces "
        "over 50 different oil and petroleum products.\n"
        "\n"
        "• The refinery employs over 3,000 people and is an important "
        "economic driver for the Krasnodar region. However, its "
        "operations have also caused some local environmental pollution "
        "concerns. Rosneft has invested in new equipment and processes to "
        "help reduce emissions and waste.\n"
        "\n"
        "• In recent years, the refinery has undergone major upgrades and "
        "renovations to improve efficiency, reduce emissions, and enable "
        "production of higher quality Euro-5 compliant fuels. Rosneft "
        "plans to continue modernizing the refinery.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Most of the crude oil processed at the refinery comes from "
        "Rosneft's oil fields in Western Siberia via pipeline. The "
        "refined products are distributed by pipeline, rail, river "
        "transport and road tankers.\n"
        "\n"
        "• The refinery produces most of the fuels and petroleum products "
        "used in southern Russia, including the large cities of "
        "Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, Stavropol, and Sochi. Its jet fuel is "
        "also used at airports across southern Russia.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Future plans for the refinery include increasing its oil "
        "refining capacity to 14 million tons per year and producing more "
        "environmentally-friendly Euro-6 motor fuels. Rosneft aims to "

        "\n"
        "• Federal Highways M4 and M29 pass just north and west of the "
        "refinery, connecting it to other parts of Krasnodar Krai and "

        "\n"
        "• A railway line runs along the northern edge of the refinery, "

        "transport of crude oil and petroleum products to and from the "
        "refinery.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Residential areas in the Primorsky neighborhood are located "

        "Other chatbots like GPT-3 or NAME_45 aim to seem as human-like "
        "and intelligent as possible.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Chat abilities: NAME_44 has basic conversational abilities and "
        "can answer simple questions or have casual discussions on most "
        "topics. However, its knowledge and language abilities are quite "
        "limited compared to the broad, open-domain capabilities of "

        "• Safety: NAME_44 is engineered with safety and ethics in mind. "
        "It is designed to avoid potential harms and be transparent about "
        "its AI nature. In contrast, many other chatbots are focused "
        "primarily on performance and do not address risks from deception "
        "or manipulation. GPT-3 in particular has raised some concerns "
        "due to its advanced abilities and lack of safeguards.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Purpose: NAME_44 is meant to serve as a helpful and harmless "
        "AI assistant. It does not have a strong commercial purpose or "

        "\n"
        "```java\n"

        "1. I did not maintain the original hierarchical structure of "
        "Business Area > Business Category > Business Process Title. I "
        "presented all the elements at the same level, losing the "
        "hierarchy.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Within each Business Area, the Business Categories and "
        "Business Process Titles are not logically grouped together. They "
        "are scattered, lacking coherence. For example, under Content "
        "Creation (NAME_1), Topic Selection, Content Writing, and Content "
        "Design should be grouped together, but in my response they are "
        "separated. \n"
        "\n"

        "are left-aligned, lacking the visual cue for the reader to "
        "understand the hierarchical relationships.\n"

        '4. The headings "Business Area", "Business Category" and '
        '"Business Process Title" are not clearly specified and '
        "distinguished. They look like just another element in each "
        "column. The headings should be more prominently displayed to "
        "define the column contents.\n"
        "\n"
        "5. There is inconsistency in the level of detail for each "
        "element. Some Business Process Titles are very high-level while "
        "others are too granular, lacking parallelism in the response. "
        'For example, "NAME_2 Identify Topic" is too high-level compared '
        'to "CD03 Manage Bounced Emails".\n'

        "6. There is redundancy in some of the elements. For example, "
        '"Subscriber Engagement" and "Audience Engagement" are quite '
        'similar. "Monetization Strategies" and "Revenue Generation" are '
        "also redundant. Some consolidation is needed.\n"

        "7. There are some missing elements compared to the original "
        'architecture. For example, the "Content Promotion" Business '
        "Category and related Business Process Titles are missing in my "
        "response. \n"

        "\n"
        "2. Related elements within each Business Area are logically "

        "bold. This helps the reader understand the column contents.\n"

        "4. The level of detail is made consistent for all elements. The "

        'and "Audience Engagement" are combined under "Content '
        'Distribution (CD)". "Monetization Strategies" and "Revenue '
        'Generation" are covered under the single "Revenue Generation '
        '(NAME_16)" Business Area.\n'

        '"Content Publishing" is placed after "Content Writing" and '
        '"Content Design".\n'
        "\n"
        "8. The table is formatted properly with consistent column widths "
        "and spacing for easier readability. Headings are made prominent "
        "using bold formatting.\n"

        'Influencer Promotions". This provides more granular coverage of '
        "key activities.\n"

        '3. Under "Subscriber Communication", "SM04 Perform Subscriber '
        'Outreach" is further expanded into distinct Business Process '
        'Titles like "Schedule Regular Outreach", "Personalize Outreach '

        "5. Parallel Business Process Titles are named consistently. For "
        'example, "NAME_29 Schedule Content for Publishing" is used '
        'instead of "NAME_32 Schedule Content". The naming follows a '

        "room for improvement in my responses. Here are some ways I can "
        "enhance my performance:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Provide a more comprehensive architecture coverage. The "
        "current response covers only select Business Areas, Categories "
        "and Processes. I can identify and include additional elements to "
        "develop a more exhaustive newsletter architecture. For example, "
        "I can add Business Areas like Analytics and Optimization, "
        "Administration and Compliance, etc. \n"
        "\n"
        "2. Offer more granular and specialized Business Process Titles. "
        "The current response articulates some fairly broad and "
        "high-level process titles. I can decompose these into more "
        "focused and specialized sub-processes to provide finer-grained "
        'coverage. For example, "Manage Sponsorship Agreement" can be '
        'expanded into "Negotiate Sponsorship Terms", "Finalize '
        'Sponsorship Contract", "Amend Sponsorship Agreement" if needed, '
        "etc.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Incorporate relevant metrics, KPIs and benchmarks. The "
        "current response includes only a couple of sample metrics. I can "
        "identify and specify key metrics, KPIs and industry benchmarks "
        "for most Business Process Titles to strengthen the practical "
        "relevance of the architecture. For example, including metrics "
        'like "Subscriber Churn Rate", "Content Freshness Index", '
        '"Traffic Source Diversity" etc. \n'
        "\n"
        "4. Provide best practice reference models. I can research "
        "industry best practices and reference models for newsletter "
        "content, distribution, monetization, compliance, etc. and "
        "incorporate relevant recommendations into the architecture "
        "response. For example, suggesting optimal content themes, "
        "sponsorship types, privacy policy inclusions, etc. \n"
        "\n"
        "5. Format the response for enhanced visual appeal. I can improve "
        "the formatting by using tools like nested tables, text "
        "highlighting, icons, diagrams, etc. to make the response more "
        "visually engaging and easier to navigate. For example, using "
        "nested tables to show hierarchy, icons for KPIs, etc.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. Review and proofread the response for any errors or "
        "inconsistencies. Additional passes to review, verify and improve "
        "the response can strengthen it from all aspects including "
        "content, format, consistency, conciseness, etc. For example, "
        "checking for parallel sentence structure, consistent heading "
        "styles, etc.\n"
        "\n"
        "7. Provide examples and samples for key elements. Including "
        "concrete examples and samples for some of the key Business "
        "Areas, Categories, Processes and Metrics can help make the "
        "architecture more tangible and pragmatic. For example, sample "
        "newsletter content themes, templates, workflows, etc. \n"

        "content": "Here are some additional ways I can improve my newsletter "
        "architecture response:\n"
        "\n"
        "8. Offer alternative versions for different contexts. I can "
        "provide alternative architecture versions tailored for specific "
        "newsletter types (e.g. curated newsletter vs promotional "
        "newsletter), business models (e.g. free newsletter vs paid "
        "subscription model), target audiences (e.g. B2B newsletter vs "
        "B2C) etc. The customized versions can articulate elements that "
        "are most relevant for the specific context.\n"
        "\n"
        "9. Suggest an optimal workflow and sequence. I can map out an "
        "optimized end-to-end workflow that articulates the sequence and "
        "interdependencies between different Business Areas, Categories "
        "and Processes. This can help demonstrate how to streamline the "
        "overall newsletter operations for maximum productivity and "
        "efficiency. \n"
        "\n"
        "10. Provide implementation recommendations. I can offer "
        "practical recommendations on how to implement the proposed "
        "architecture. This can include suggestions related to phasing "
        "the implementation in stages, mapping the architecture to the "
        "organization's existing tools and systems, assigning ownership "
        "for different elements, determining resource requirements, "
        "preparing implementation plans, overcoming challenges, etc.\n"
        "\n"
        "11. Compare with alternative architectures. I can analyze "
        "alternative newsletter architecture models and compare them with "
        "my proposed response. Discussing the relative pros and cons can "
        "provide a balanced perspective and help determine the most "
        "appropriate model for a given situation. Some examples of "
        "alternative architectures include linear content production "
        "models, agile iterative models, outsourced models, etc.\n"
        "\n"
        "12. Offer to customize the architecture as needed. I can "
        "indicate that the proposed newsletter architecture can be "
        "tailored and customized to suit an organization's unique needs, "
        "priorities, resources, technical infrastructure, and overall "
        "business goals. The elements, level of detail and implementation "
        "recommendations can be adapted as required for optimal "
        "alignment. Customization may include adding, removing, modifying "
        "or reorganizing different components of the architecture.\n"
        "\n"
        "13. Provide references and citations. I can cite industry "
        "reports, expert opinions, case studies and best practices to "
        "substantiate recommendations and add credibility to the "
        "architecture response. Referencing authoritative sources can "
        "reinforce the practical relevance and validity of the suggested "
        "elements, metrics, workflows, etc. \n"
        "\n"
        "Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on "
        "any of these ways to enhance my newsletter architecture response "
        "further. I can also revise my previous responses by "
        "incorporating some of these improvements if needed.",
        "role": "assistant",
    },
    {"content": "You can do even better than this", "role": "user"},
    {
        "content": "You are right, there is always room for improvement. Here are "
        "some additional ways I can significantly enhance my newsletter "
        "architecture response:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Develop multiple sample architectures for different "
        "scenarios. I can create tailored sample architecture models for "
        "specific newsletter types (e.g. daily newsletters vs weekly "
        "roundups), business models (e.g. free vs paid, ad-supported vs "
        "sponsorship), organization sizes (e.g. small startup vs large "
        "publisher), target audiences (e.g. general interest vs niche) "
        "etc. Comparing alternative samples can help determine an optimal "
        "model for each scenario.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Provide interactive visual representations. I can supplement "
        "the tabular architecture format with interactive content like "
        "flowcharts, process maps, relationship diagrams, wireframes, "
        "etc. Visual and interactive models may convey the key components "
        "and their interlinkages more intuitively. Users can explore "
        "different pathways based on their priorities. \n"
        "\n"
        "3. Incorporate a phased roadmap for implementation. I can "
        "outline a practical roadmap for how the proposed architecture "
        "can be implemented in a phased manner, starting from a basic "
        "model to more sophisticated versions. The roadmap can articulate "
        "key milestones, resource requirements, estimated timelines, "
        "quick wins, and how to progressively build on successes. This "
        "step-by-step approach may seem more achievable than an overly "
        "complex architecture.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Map the architecture to key software and tools. I can "
        "demonstrate how the proposed components in the architecture can "
        "be supported using popular newsletter tools and platforms. For "
        "example, mapping content creation to tools like Substack or "

        "7. Offer to set up a pilot newsletter initiative. I can propose "
        "setting up a small-scale pilot newsletter initiative to test "
        "different components of the architecture in practice. Starting "
        "with a pilot project allows validating assumptions, fine-tuning "
        "elements, and gathering hands-on learnings to strengthen the "
        "overall architecture. The pilot can focus on select areas such "
        "as content production, distribution, advertising, paid "
        "subscriptions etc. based on priorities.\n"
        "\n"
        "8. Provide a newsletter operations manual. I can develop a "
        "comprehensive operations manual or playbook articulating how to "
        "execute key activities within the proposed architecture. The "
        "manual can offer step-by-step guidance on essential processes "
        "like creating a content calendar, soliciting sponsorships, "
        "managing subscriptions, optimizing open rates, running "
        "promotions, etc. This can supplement the architecture by "
        "demonstrating practical implementation details. \n"

        "9. Discuss metrics optimization and analytics. I can articulate "
        "strategies and best practices for optimizing key metrics and "
        "gaining actionable insights using analytics. Discussing how to "
        "analyze and interpret metrics such as open rates, click-through "
        "rates, traffic sources, subscriber churn, content engagement, "
        "etc. can help readers measure the performance and health of "
        "their newsletter initiative. Metrics optimization may involve "
        "A/B testing, personalization, timing experiments, etc.\n"
        "\n"
        "10. Highlight opportunities for continuous improvement. I can "
        "emphasize that the proposed newsletter architecture should be "
        "treated as a living document that is updated periodically based "
        "on learnings and feedback. I can discuss approaches for gaining "
        "input from readers, sponsors, partners, and internal teams to "
        "identify opportunities for enhancing content, streamlining "
        "processes, improving metrics, reaching new audiences, "
        "diversifying revenue, building strategic partnerships, and "
        "evolving the newsletter. \n"
        "\n"
        "11. Discuss compliance with laws and regulations. I can review "
        "key laws and regulations applicable to newsletters such as GDPR, "
        "CASL, and CAN-SPAM and explain how the proposed architecture can "
        "be designed to ensure compliance. Compliance may require "
        "elements such as clear opt-in mechanisms, easy unsubscribe "
        "options, transparency into how data is collected and used, data "
        "protection measures, content moderation policies, etc. "
        "Highlighting compliance upfront can mitigate legal risks.\n"

        "significantly improve my newsletter architecture response:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Develop a dynamic and interactive architecture tool. I can "
        "create an interactive tool or simulator that allows customizing "
        "a newsletter architecture based on inputs like business goals, "
        "content types, delivery frequency, revenue models, resources, "
        "compliance needs, etc. The output can be a tailored architecture "
        "model with relevant components, sample metrics, workflows, and "
        "implementation guidelines. An interactive tool may be far more "
        "useful than a static written response.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Provide a benchmarking framework. I can develop a "
        "benchmarking framework for readers to evaluate their existing "
        "newsletter initiative against industry standards and best "
        "practices. The framework can incorporate benchmarks for metrics "
        "like open rates, click-through rates, traffic sources, "
        "subscriber churn, content freshness, advertising or sponsorship "
        "revenue, costs, and staff productivity. Comparing their "
        "performance to benchmarks can help identify opportunities for "
        "improvement. \n"
        "\n"
        "3. Offer consulting and advisory services. I can propose "
        "offering dedicated consulting and advisory services to help "
        "organizations design, launch, improve or revamp their newsletter "
        "strategy and operations. Advisory services may include current "
        "state analysis, architecture design, pilot project "
        "implementation, metrics optimization, partnership "
        "recommendations, compliance reviews, staff training, etc. "
        "Hands-on expert guidance and support can be far more valuable "
        "than a generic written response.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Provide a newsletter toolkit with templates and examples. I "
        "can develop a comprehensive toolkit with templates, examples, "
        "and reusable content for key elements in the architecture like "
        "email newsletter templates, content calendars, editorial "
        "guidelines, subscription forms, unsubscribe pages, advertising "
        "specs, sponsorship prospectuses, etc. A practical toolkit can "
        "supplement the architecture by giving readers ready-to-use "
        "components to accelerate implementation. \n"
        "\n"
        "5. Discuss a newsletter content management system. I can propose "
        "and compare options for a centralized content management system "
        "to support the creation, management, and distribution of email "
        "newsletters. A CMS can facilitate collaboration, ensure "
        "consistency, enable personalization, integrate with analytics, "
        "and generally streamline the content production process. "
        "Exploring technology solutions can strengthen the practical "
        "utility of the architecture.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. Highlight opportunities for strategic partnerships. I can "
        "discuss potential opportunities for forming strategic "
        "partnerships to enhance a newsletter initiative. Partnerships "
        "may include content collaborations, co-marketing relationships, "
        "sponsorships, advertising networks, technology integrations, "
        "data partnerships, and joint venture models. Evaluating "
        "partnership options can help diversify and scale newsletter "
        "operations for greater business impact.\n"

        "newsletter architecture response:\n"
        "\n"
        "7. Discuss a newsletter business plan. I can propose developing "
        "a comprehensive business plan to outline how to transform a "
        "newsletter initiative into a viable business. The plan can "
        "articulate a sustainable business model by estimating costs and "
        "potential revenue streams from advertising, paid subscriptions, "
        "sponsorships, strategic partnerships, events, and other sources. "
        "It can also define growth strategies, marketing plans, product "
        "roadmaps, funding requirements, key hires, and financial "
        "projections. A well-designed business plan is essential for "
        "commercializing a newsletter.\n"
        "\n"
        "8. Provide newsletter staffing recommendations. I can suggest an "
        "optimal staffing model for a given newsletter architecture. This "
        "may include roles such as writers, editors, designers, community "
        "managers, advertising and sponsorship specialists, marketing and "
        "growth experts, data analysts, and operations managers. "
        "Discussing key skills and responsibilities for each role can "
        "help ensure the newsletter team is adequately staffed and "
        "skilled. Staffing levels would depend on the scope and "
        "complexity of the specific architecture. \n"
        "\n"
        "9. Discuss approaches for newsletter marketing and growth. I can "
        "articulate strategies and techniques for building awareness and "
        "growing the readership of a newsletter. Approaches may include "
        "social sharing, search engine optimization, influencer "
        "collaborations, paid advertising, email list partnerships, "
        "referral programs, live events, and more. An effective marketing "
        "plan is crucial for attracting new readers and sustaining "
        "newsletter growth over the long run. \n"
        "\n"
        "10. Propose a technology infrastructure model. I can recommend a "
        "suite of technologies to support key functions in a newsletter "
        "architecture like content creation, email delivery and "
        "automation, subscriptions and payments, analytics and "
        "optimization, marketing, and community engagement. An integrated "
        "set of tools and platforms can provide a robust infrastructure "
        "for any newsletter initiative. However, technology choices would "
        "depend on the unique needs, resources, and technical "
        "capabilities of each organization.\n"
        "\n"
        "11. Discuss options for generating referral or affiliate "
        "revenue. I can propose ways to earn additional revenue by "
        "implementing a referral program where readers refer new "
        "subscribers or through an affiliate program where earnings are "
        "generated when referred readers make purchases from partnering "
        "brands. Successful referral and affiliate programs can provide "
        "ongoing income streams beyond a newsletter's primary business "
        "model. But they require investing in the tools, content, and "
        "relationships to drive high-quality referrals.\n"

        "Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on "

        "ways to significantly enhance my newsletter architecture "

        "architecture response:\n"

        "12. Discuss ways to diversify into related products and "
        "services. I can suggest opportunities for leveraging a "
        "newsletter audience and expertise to develop other "
        "revenue-generating products and services. For example, offering "
        "paid research reports, online courses, consulting services, live "
        "events, branded merchandise, paid community memberships, and "
        "more. Developing a product ecosystem around a newsletter can "
        "open up new income streams and reduce reliance on any single "
        "source like advertising or sponsorships. However, it requires "
        "investing resources in building out additional offerings.\n"
        "\n"
        "13. Highlight options for paid membership or subscription "
        "models. I can articulate how to implement paid membership or "
        "subscription models for newsletters such as tiered subscription "
        "plans, freemium models with paid upgrades, time-limited free "
        "trials, bundle deals with other paid products, and pay-as-you-go "
        "models based on consumption. Paid subscriptions can provide "
        "predictable and recurring revenue but may require offering "
        "additional benefits and resources for members to justify the "
        "cost. Options would depend on newsletter content, audience "
        "needs, and competitive alternatives.\n"
        "\n"
        "14. Discuss strategies for newsletter productization and "
        "scalability. I can outline an approach for evolving a newsletter "
        "into a scalable media product business. This may involve "
        "productizing content into a series of thematic newsletters, "
        "online courses or research reports, diversifying into related "
        "content channels like podcasts or video, licensing or "
        "franchising newsletter brands and technology to other "
        "publishers, and systematically optimizing key metrics and "
        "processes for greater efficiency and productivity. Developing a "
        "scalable product model can help a newsletter business achieve "
        "higher growth and profitability. But it requires an investment "
        "in content, tools, marketing, and operational best practices.\n"

        "15. Provide financial projections and valuations. I can "
        "demonstrate the potential financial upside of a newsletter "
        "business by providing sample projections for revenue, costs, "
        "cash flow, and company valuations over time based on different "
        "growth scenarios. Financial forecasts can help determine the "
        "viability and attractiveness of a newsletter model for both "
        "internal planning and external stakeholders like potential "
        "acquirers or investors. However, projections would be "
        "speculative since performance depends on many variables. "
        "Multiple scenarios should be modeled.\n"

        "16. Discuss options for strategic exits. I can outline potential "
        "strategic exits from a newsletter business such as selling to a "
        "larger media company, taking the company public through an IPO, "
        "merging with a competitor to gain scale, or selling a partial "
        "ownership stake to private equity investors. Exploring exit "
        "options can help set long",

        "propose ways to license newsletter content, brands, technology, "
        "and operating procedures to other publishers to generate revenue "
        "with little additional effort. Licensing options include "
        "allowing republication of content in exchange for fees, "
        "licensing the use of newsletter brands and community data to "
        "target advertising, and franchising the newsletter model and "
        "tools to entrepreneurs in exchange for ongoing royalties. "
        "However, content licensing and franchising also introduce risks "
        "around quality control, brand reputation, and loss of audience "
        "ownership. Strict guidelines and oversight processes would be "
        "required.\n"
        "\n"
        "18. Highlight opportunities for paid content and research "
        "syndication. I can suggest distributing paid newsletter content "
        "and research reports through third-party syndication partners in "
        "exchange for a share of sales revenue. Syndication can expand "
        "the reach and readership of a newsletter product line with "
        "limited additional work. But syndication deals would need to "
        "offer incentives for partners to actively promote the paid "
        "content to their audiences. Revenue share and exclusivity terms "
        "must also be negotiated. \n"

        "propose developing and delivering custom newsletter and content "
        "marketing training programs for other companies through "
        "partnerships with corporate learning and development "
        "departments. Education partnerships can leverage newsletter "
        "expertise to generate high-margin revenue from large enterprise "
        "clients with training and development budgets. However, "
        "developing effective and engaging enterprise training content "

        "suggest opportunities to license newsletter brands, content, "
        "technology, and business models to publishers in international "
        "markets as a way to scale globally. International licensing "
        "deals can provide new revenue streams from fast-growing media "
        "markets with limited additional investment. But they also "
        "introduce risks around localization needs, cultural differences, "

        "Mitosis is a process where a single cell divides into two "
        "identical daughter cells (cell division). During mitosis one "
        "cell, divides once to form two similar cells. The major purpose "
        "of mitosis is for growth and to replace worn-out cells. If not "
        "corrected in time, mistakes made during mitosis can result in "
        "changes in the DNA that can potentially lead to genetic "
        "disorders. Mitosis is divided into five phases: 1. Interphase: "
        "The DNA in the cell is copied in preparation for cell division, "
        "this results in two identical complete sets of chromosomes. "
        "Outside of the nucleus are two centrosomes, each containing a "
        "pair of centrioles, these structures are critical for cell "
        "division. During interphase, microtubules extend from these "
        "centrosomes. 2. Prophase: The chromosomes condense into X-shaped "
        "structures that can be easily seen under a microscope. Each "
        "chromosome is composed of two sister chromatids, containing "
        "identical genetic information. The chromosomes pair up so that "
        "both copies of chromosome 1 are together, both copies of "
        "chromosome 2 are together, and so on. At the end of prophase, "
        "the membrane around the nucleus in the cell dissolves away "
        "releasing the chromosomes. The mitotic spindle, consisting of "
        "the microtubules and other proteins, extends across the cell "
        "between the centrioles as they move to opposite poles of the "
        "cell. 3. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up neatly end-to-end "
        "along the center (equator) of the cell. The centrioles are now "
        "at opposite poles of the cell with the mitotic spindle fibers "
        "extending from them. The mitotic spindle fibers attach to each "
        "of the sister chromatids. 4. Anaphase: The sister chromatids are "
        "then pulled apart by the mitotic spindle which pulls one "
        "chromatid to one pole and the other chromatid to the opposite "
        "pole. 5. Telophase: At each pole of the cell, a full set of "
        "chromosomes gather together. A membrane forms around each set of "
        "chromosomes to create two new nuclei. The single cell then "
        "pinches in the middle to form two separate daughter cells each "
        "containing a full set of chromosomes within a nucleus. This "
        "process is known as cytokinesis.",

        "Overdue rains and cooler temperatures have given Quebec fire "
        "crews a chance to launch their assault on dozens of wildfires, "
        "but the reprieve for one part of Canada comes as fires in the "
        "west of the country have once again forced residents to flee "
        "their homes. The country has been struggling with an "
        "“unprecedented” wildfire season, with nearly 450 forest fires "
        "across the country on Sunday, 220 of which were burning out of "
        "control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire "
        "Centre. In Quebec, crews are hoping to attack dozens of blazes "
        "that have been temporarily weakened by favourable weather. “We "
        "went from a reactive mode to an offensive mode,” Quebec’s "
        "forestry minister, NAME_48, said in a weekend news conference. "
        "But more than 14,000 residents remain under evacuation as the "
        "mix of domestic and foreign firefighters and Canadian armed "
        "forces members tackle the blazes. The 117 wildfires across "
        "Quebec underscore the record-breaking nature of the spring fire "
        "season that has displaced tens of thousands and choked the air "
        "of more than 100 million people in eastern North America. Quebec "
        "wildfires have already scorched 740,000 hectares of boreal "
        "forest, more than 300 times the average during the spring season "
        "over the past decade. In the coming days, nearly 350 "
        "firefighters from the EU will join nearly 1,000 personnel "

        "western Canada have watched as new blazes crop up and move "

        "NAME_50 was evacuated on Friday for the second time this year "
        "after a nearby fire crossed fireguards and moved perilously "

        "up and the winds come up, so we’re not out of the woods yet,” "

        "1. Make sure you're setting the size constraint after adding all "
        "the widgets to the layout. It won't have any effect until the "
        "layout has its final contents.\n"

        "parent layout of all the widgets. If there are any intermediate "
        "layouts, you'll need to set the size constraint on those as "
        "well.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Try calling resize() or updateGeometry() on the parent widget "
        "after setting the size constraint. This will trigger a resize "
        "event and force the layout to resize to its sizeHint().\n"

        "# or\n"
        "container1.updateGeometry()\n"

        "scrum. The Scrum Master facilitates Agile ceremonies like the "
        "daily scrum, sprint planning, retrospectives, etc. The "
        "Development Team attends and participates but does not lead.\n"

    {
        "content": "Necessary characteristics for an individual in a Scrum team "
        "include:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Adaptability: Scrum teams need to adapt to change quickly. "
        "Requirements often change, and the team must be able to adjust "
        "priorities and work accordingly. Team members should be "
        "flexible, open to change, and able to switch focus when "
        "needed. \n"
        "\n"
        "2. Collaboration: Scrum teams work collaboratively, with team "
        "members helping each other accomplish a common goal. Strong "
        "communication, interpersonal skills, and a willingness to "
        "collaborate with others are important. \n"
        "\n"
        "3. Commitment: Scrum team members should be committed to the "
        "team's success and delivering maximum value. They need to commit "
        "to sprint goals, do whatever it takes to achieve them, and be "
        "dedicated to continuous improvement.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Creativity: Coming up with innovative solutions is key to "
        "delivering maximum value. Team members should be able to think "
        "outside the box, see opportunities for improvement, and come up "
        "with creative solutions to problems. \n"
        "\n"
        "5. Time-management: Scrum teams work in short sprints, so the "
        "ability to focus, prioritize important work, and manage time "
        "effectively is essential. Team members need to break down work "
        "into concrete tasks, estimate how long those tasks will take, "
        "and ensure work is completed each sprint.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. Technical skills: For a development team, technical and "
        "engineering skills are obviously necessary. Team members need to "
        "be able to build, test, deploy and improve the product. They "
        "should have up-to-date technical and domain knowledge.\n"
        "\n"
        "7. Teamwork: Most importantly, team members must be able to work "
        "together in a cohesive, collaborative team environment. They "
        "need interpersonal skills, the ability to compromise, and a "
        "team-first mindset. Individual ego or needs should be secondary "
        "to the team and its goals.\n"
        "\n"
        "In summary, adaptability, collaboration, commitment, creativity, "
        "time-management, technical ability, and teamwork are key "
        "characteristics for individuals in a Scrum team. Scrum teams "
        "require these traits to function effectively, maximize value, "
        "and achieve continuous improvement. Individuals without these "
        "characteristics would likely struggle in such an environment.\n"

        "2. Investors: If the project is funded by outside investors, "
        "they would qualify as key external stakeholders. Investors want "

        "product's success and meeting key milestones or revenue targets. "

        "investors periodically.\n"

        "product revenue or other metrics\n"
        "- Poor performance may mean reduced future funding or investment "

        "- The team is accountable to investors for progress reports and "
        "explaining any issues \n"
        "\n"
        "External stakeholders like customers and investors are important "
        "to consider because while the internal team executes the work, "

        "needs. The team can build a product that meets all internal "
        "requirements but still fails if external stakeholders are not "
        "satisfied or do not see the necessary value. \n"
        "\n"
        "Managing external stakeholders requires effort to understand "

        'information at booking." However, after 9 months the project is '
        "failing. I would review the initial scope and requirements to "

        "\n"
        "• Ear irrigation or ear syringing: This is a very common method. "
        "It involves using a stream of warm water to gently irrigate the "
        "ear and remove the earwax. You can use an ear irrigation kit or "
        "bulb syringe available at pharmacies. It's best done by a doctor "
        "or nurse to avoid damage to the ear.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ear drops: Ear drops that soften the earwax, such as mineral "
        "or baby oil, glycerin, or commercial ear wax removal drops can "
        "help loosen the wax. You put a few drops in the ear, wait "
        "several minutes and then drain out the excess with a bulb "
        "syringe. It may require a few rounds of drops to loosen the wax "
        "enough. These drops are considered very safe for most people.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ear wax extraction: If the earwax blockage is significant, an "
        "ear doctor may need to extract the wax using special "
        "instruments. Ear wax extraction kits for home use are also "
        "available but should be used carefully to avoid damage. It is "
        "best to see a doctor for extraction.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ear candling: Ear candling is not recommended. It can lead to "
        "ear damage, earwax impaction, and even ear injuries. It is "
        "considered unsafe and ineffective.\n"
        "\n"
        "• See a doctor: If the earwax blockage causes symptoms like "
        "muffled hearing, ear fullness, ear pain, ringing in the ears or "
        "coughing, see your doctor. They can examine your ears and "
        "determine if any treatment like ear irrigation or ear wax "
        "extraction is needed using special instruments. They can "
        "properly and safely clear the wax blockage.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ear wax softening drops: For some people with persistent ear "
        "wax blockage, occasional use of over-the-counter ear wax "
        "softening drops can help prevent re-blockage. Mineral or baby "
        "oil 2-3 drops 2-3 times a week is often sufficient. But check "
        "with your doctor first before using any drops long term.\n"
        "\n"
        "So in summary, the safest and most effective methods are ear "
        "irrigation, ear drops, and having a doctor examine your ears and "
        "perform ear wax extraction if needed. Ear candling should be "
        "avoided. For persistent blockage, occasional ear wax softening "
        "drops may help prevent re-blockage.",

        "\n"
        "• Ear drops: Ear drops containing antibiotics to treat "

        "include hydrocortisone, neomycin, and polymyxin B. Prescription "
        "ear drop options include Ciprodex and Cortisporin. Use the drops "
        "as directed for 7-10 days.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Oral pain relievers: Take over-the-counter pain relievers like "
        "ibuprofen, acetaminophen, naproxen to relieve pain from the ear "
        "inflammation.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Apply heat: Placing a warm washcloth over the affected ear may "
        "help relieve pain. Do not use heat if the eardrum has ruptured.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ear wick or irrigation: If the ear canal is swollen shut, a "
        "doctor may insert an ear wick to help the ear drops penetrate. "
        "Ear irrigation can also help remove debris and pus to allow ear "
        "drops to enter the canal.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Ear drainage: If there is pus draining from the ear, a doctor "
        "may need to make a small incision to drain the pus and place a "
        "temporary ear wick to keep the ear open for drops.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Oral antibiotics: For severe or persistent infection, your "
        "doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics, in addition to ear drops. "
        "Some options include amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin or cephalexin. "
        "Use as directed to clear the infection.\n"

        "other treatments or if swelling closes the ear canal, a "
        "procedure called canaloplasty may be needed to open the ear "
        "canal. This is only done by an ear specialist as a last resort.\n"

        "rapid rate. In sinus tachycardia:\n"
        "\n"
        "• The heart rate is usually 100 to 160 beats per minute.\n"

    {
        "content": "Here are the steps for managing Bell's palsy:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Diagnose the condition. Bell's palsy is usually diagnosed "
        "based on symptoms and physical exam. Your doctor will check for "
        "facial muscle weakness or paralysis, inability to close the eye "
        "or mouth on one side, drooping of the brow or corner of the "
        "mouth. They will rule out other possible causes like stroke or "
        "Lyme disease.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Start corticosteroids. Oral corticosteroids like prednisone "
        "are commonly used to reduce inflammation of the facial nerve. "
        "Treatment should be started within 72 hours of symptom onset for "
        "the best results. Steroids help speed up recovery and improve "
        "facial function.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Antiviral drugs. Antiviral medications like acyclovir or "
        "valacyclovir are also often used to treat Bell's palsy. They may "
        "be used alone or combined with steroids. Antivirals can help "
        "reduce severity and duration of symptoms if taken early.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Eye care. Since Bell's palsy can cause inability to close the "
        "eye, eye drops or ointments may be used to keep the eye moist "
        "and prevent infection and corneal abrasion. Eye patches, glasses "
        "or goggles can also help protect the eye.\n"
        "\n"
        "5. Physical therapy. Doing facial exercises, massage and "
        "hot/cold compresses can help stimulate the facial muscles and "
        "nerves. This may aid in recovery of muscle control and function. "
        "Physical therapy should start as soon as possible for the best "
        "results.\n"
        "\n"
        "6. Pain management. Over-the-counter pain relievers may be used "
        "to manage any pain from facial muscle spasms or headache. "
        "Prescription medication can be provided for more severe pain.\n"
        "\n"
        "7. Follow up. Follow up with your doctor regularly to monitor "
        "progression of symptoms and facial function. Repeat "
        "corticosteroid treatment may be needed in some cases. Most "
        "people with Bell's palsy recover completely in a few weeks to "
        "months.\n"
        "\n"
        "8. Surgery. For those with little or no improvement in 9-12 "
        "months, surgery may be recommended to prevent permanent muscle "
        "contractures. The most common procedure is facial reanimation "
        "surgery using a nerve graft to restore facial nerve function.\n"
        "\n"
        "The key factors in managing Bell's palsy are early diagnosis, "
        "prompt treatment with corticosteroids and antivirals, protecting "
        "the eye, physical therapy, pain control and close follow up and "

        "1. Diagnose the underlying cause. The most common causes of "
        "parotiditis are bacterial infection, viral infection, and "
        "obstruction/stones. Take a thorough history and physical exam to "
        "determine the likely cause:\n"
        "\n"
        "• Bacterial infection: Usually due to NAME_1 aureus. Patient "
        "presents with acute onset of unilateral swelling, pain, redness, "
        "and tenderness. May have purulent drainage from NAME_2's duct.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Viral infection: Often due to mumps virus. Bilateral swelling "
        "and pain, preceded by prodromal symptoms like fever, malaise, "
        "and headache. Confirm with mumps IgM/IgG titers.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Obstruction: Swelling is gradual and intermittent, may be "
        "related to meals. Pain is usually dull and radiates to ear. "
        "Diagnose with imaging - ultrasound, CT or sialography.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Other causes: Consider autoimmune, sarcoidosis, HIV, etc. "
        "based on risk factors and clinical presentation. Order "
        "appropriate laboratory tests to rule in or out.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Hospitalization: Admit patient for severe dehydration, high "
        "fever, significant trismus preventing adequate PO intake, or if "
        "diagnosis is uncertain. Monitor and hydrate, start empiric "
        "antibiotics.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Imaging: If diagnosis unclear or patient not improving with "
        "conservative treatment, order ultrasound, CT scan, MRI or "
        "sialography to identify ductal obstruction, sialolithiasis, "
        "abscess, or other anatomical abnormalities.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Antibiotics: For bacterial parotiditis, start empiric "
        "broad-spectrum IV antibiotics to cover NAME_1 and Strep. Oral "
        "antibiotics for 7-10 days are usually sufficient if patient can "
        "tolerate PO. For mumps, antibiotics will not help.\n"

        "IV fluids if unable to take PO. Hydration helps loosen "
        "secretions and provides symptomatic relief.\n"
        "\n"
        "7. Warm compresses: Apply warm compresses to the affected "
        "parotid gland 4-6 times a day to help relieve pain and improve "

        "for a Primary Care Network (PCN) in the UK. However, a typical "
        "PCN serves a population between 30,000 to 50,000 patients. The "
        "key factors determining a PCN size include:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Population density: In urban areas with higher population "
        "density, a smaller population size of around 30,000 patients may "
        "be suitable for a PCN. In rural or sparsely populated areas, a "
        "larger population of 40,000-50,000 patients is often needed to "
        "make a viable network.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Number of GP practices: A PCN requires at least 2-3 medium "
        "sized GP practices working together to provide extended access "
        "and a range of primary care services. More GP practices may join "
        "together to form a network in some areas.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Geographical factors: Natural geographical boundaries and "
        "communities also help determine the population covered by a PCN. "
        "The PCN should serve a natural community or neighborhood where "
        "patients access local healthcare services.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Deprivation level: In deprived areas with greater health "
        "needs, a smaller PCN size may be appropriate to ensure focused "
        "care to the local population. Larger, more affluent populations "
        "may suit a bigger PCN size. \n"
        "\n"
        "5. Local commissioning decisions: Local commissioners ultimately "
        "determine the size of the PCN based on the local context, "
        "priorities and available resources. They try to strike a balance "
        "between having large enough PCNs to benefit from shared staffing "
        "and resources versus small enough to remain locally focused.\n"
        "\n"
        "In summary, while there is no strict rule, most PCNs in the UK "
        "serve between 30,000 to 50,000 patients. The exact size depends "
        "on the local population density, number of GP practices, "
        "geographical factors, level of deprivation and local "
        "commissioning decisions based on local needs and resources. The "
        "key is to have large enough PCNs to gain benefits of scale but "

        "\n"
        '1. Case of the pronoun: The pronoun "you" is in the dative case '
        "in this sentence, indicating the indirect object. In Polish, the "
        'dative form of "you" is "tobie", not "ciebie". "Ciebie" is the '
        'accusative form, used for direct objects. Since "you" is the '
        'indirect object of the verb "forget" here, the dative "tobie" is '
        "required.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Position of the pronoun: In Polish, the indirect object "
        'pronoun usually comes before the verb. So "tobie" precedes '
        '"zapominam" in the correct phrase. If "ciebie" was used, it '
        "would come after the verb as the direct object, which is "
        "incorrect in this sentence. \n"
        "\n"
        '3. Meaning: The sentence "Nigdy nie zapominam o ciebie" would '
        'actually mean "I never forget about you" with "you" as the '
        'direct object. But the intended meaning is "I never forget about '

        "\n"
        "• Chloramphenicol - Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that helps "
        "treat bacterial eye infections. It works by stopping the growth "
        "of bacteria.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Hydroxyethylcellulose - Hydroxyethylcellulose is a lubricating "
        "and thickening agent used in eye drops. It helps soothe and "
        "lubricate the eye.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Sodium Citrate - Sodium citrate acts as a buffering agent to "
        "help balance the pH in the eye drop solution. It helps make the "
        "solution compatible with the eye's tissues.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Citric Acid - Citric acid is also used as a buffering agent in "
        "the solution to adjust the pH.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Boric acid - Boric acid has antiseptic properties and helps "
        "preserve the solution. It prevents the growth of bacteria, fungi "
        "and other microbes.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Sodium tetraborate - Sodium tetraborate is a boron compound "
        "used as a preservative in the solution. It helps prevent "
        "microbial contamination.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Purified water - Purified water is used as the solvent and "
        "diluent in the solution.\n"
        "\n"
        "The eye drops also contain some additional inactive ingredients "
        "like glycerol, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide, and "

        "\n"
        "1. Inguinal hernia: The most likely diagnosis. The pain is in "
        "the inguinal area and worsens with movement or walking when "
        "intra-abdominal pressure increases. When supine, the herniated "
        "bowel/tissue returns inside, relieving the pain. This is common "
        "in elderly men.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Inguinal lymphadenopathy: Swollen/inflamed inguinal lymph "
        "nodes. Though less likely given the excruciating pain, it can "
        "sometimes present this way. Lymphoma or infection may cause "
        "lymph node swelling.\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Meralgia paresthetica: Entrapment of the lateral femoral "
        "cutaneous nerve causing pain/numbness in the lateral upper "
        "thigh. Pain usually worsens with prolonged standing/walking, "
        "relieved by sitting - so less consistent with the presentation.\n"
        "\n"
        "4. Hip arthritis: Arthritis of the hip joint may refer pain to "
        "the inguinal area, but pain would likely be present with passive "
        "hip movement during the exam which does not seem to be the case "
        "here.\n"
        "\n"
        "5. Kidney stone: If a kidney stone was passing through the "
        "ureter, it could cause inguinal pain, but pain would likely also "
        "radiate to the groin and not be relieved completely when supine. "
        "Urinalysis may show blood.\n"
        "\n"
        "To confirm the diagnosis, some recommended tests include:\n"
        "\n"
        "1. Physical exam: Palpate the inguinal area, scrotum and femoral "
        "pulses. Check for bulges or tenderness. Test hip range of "
        "motion.\n"
        "\n"
        "2. Urinalysis: To check for signs of infection or blood (for "
        "stones)\n"
        "\n"
        "3. Abdominal/Pelvic CT: Can detect inguinal hernias, "

        "\n"
        "The most likely diagnosis is an inguinal hernia. If the hernia "

        "• NAME_7 fell ill suddenly after attending a banquet. He "
        "suffered from high fever, abdominal pain, and chills for several "
        'days. Ancient historians described his illness as a "raging '
        'fever".\n'
        "\n"
        "• The common theories about the cause of his illness include "
        "malaria, typhoid fever, or acute pancreatitis. Malaria was "
        "common in Babylon and the symptoms match. Typhoid also caused "
        "similar symptoms and outbreaks occurred in military camps. "
        "Excessive alcohol use at the banquet may have triggered "
        "pancreatitis.\n"
        "\n"
        "• His condition worsened over 10-12 days. He was unable to walk "
        "and barely able to speak. His generals thought he would recover, "
        "but his health deteriorated. \n"
        "\n"
        "• His close friend and general NAME_8 took charge of his care. "
        "Other physicians, including NAME_9, were consulted. Ancient "
        "texts mention NAME_7 was given a medicine to induce purging and "
        "sleep.\n"
        "\n"
        "• As NAME_7's condition became desperate, his generals asked him "
        "to name a successor but he did not name anyone. He lost the "
        "ability to speak for a couple of days before dying.\n"
        "\n"
        "• On June 10 or 11, 323 BCE, NAME_7 died in the royal quarters "
        "of Nebuchadnezzar II's palace in Babylon. NAME_8 took the throne "
        "and arranged for NAME_7's body to be sent to Egypt.\n"
        "\n"
        "• The cause of death was unclear even to ancient historians. "
        "Some contemporary scholars thought his death was due to natural "
        "causes from an unknown illness. Others thought he may have been "
        "poisoned. Modern analysis of historical records indicate natural "
        "causes were most likely.\n"

    {
        "content": "Taurine is generally considered safe in normal amounts from "
        "foods. As a dietary supplement, a maximum safe dosage of taurine "
        "for most adults is:\n"
        "\n"
        "• Up to 3,000 mg per day. Some studies have used dosages up to "
        "6,000 mg per day without significant side effects.\n"

        "\n"
        "Warmer room risks:\n"
        "\n"
        "• Sleeplessness: A room that is too warm can make it difficult "
        "to fall asleep and stay asleep. Your body temperature drops "
        "slightly when you sleep, and a warmer environment can disrupt "
        "this temperature regulation. You may feel overheated, restless "
        "and wake up frequently.\n"

        "• Dehydration: Sleeping in a warmer room can cause you to sweat "
        "more throughout the night, leading to dehydration if the lost "
        "fluids are not replaced. Dehydration causes headaches, dizziness "
        "and fatigue.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Respiratory problems: A warm and dry room may aggravate "
        "respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies. The heat can "
        "dry out your airways and nasal passages. Using a humidifier may "
        "help.\n"

        "• Night sweats: Sleeping in an excessively warm room is a common "
        "cause of night sweats for some people. Night sweats can "
        "interrupt your sleep and may require medical treatment if an "
        "underlying condition is present.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Irritability: Lack of sleep and rest caused by an "
        "uncomfortable sleeping environment often leads to irritability, "
        "stress and impaired mood and cognition. Your daytime "
        "productivity can suffer.\n"

        "to tense up and contract, leading to discomfort, restlessness "
        "and impaired sleep.\n"
        "\n"
        "• Higher metabolism: Your body has to work harder to maintain "
        "its core temperature in a cooler room, which can raise your "
        "metabolism and heart rate. This makes it harder to relax and "
        "sleep.\n"

        "night may lower your immunity. Cooler body temperatures can also "
        'activate your "fight or flight" stress response.\n'
        "\n"
        "• Headache: Sleeping in a chillier room may lead to tension "
        "headaches, especially if your neck muscles tense up from the "
